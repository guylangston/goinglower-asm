# cpu.anim - "Watch My Code Run"

> A visual animation of the x64; learn ASM just by watching your (highlevel) code run.

- Animate real code, not an simplified cpu model
- Target asm/c/c# ; show high-level source maps
- Interpret ASM to pseudo code 
   - "inc eax                 ; eax <- eax + 1"
   - "lea ebx, [rsi + 10]     ; ebx <- rsi + 10"
   - "xor ebx, ebx            ; ebx <- 0"

Inspired by reading the book "xpord", it too unwheeldy to lookup all the neumonics from the Intel Handbook.
